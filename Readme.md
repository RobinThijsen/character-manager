We have done this work for a team project exercise for Becode.

The purpose of the exercise : create a character manager in Javascript. We work with HTML, CSS, Javasript, Git, Github and Netlify.

We deploy the website on Netlify : https://character-manager-robin-steeve.netlify.app/

Objectives

Use best JS practices
Read documentation and test a REST API
Use a REST API with HTTP requests
Create a typical asynchronous flow : send asynchronous (promises or async/await) requests to a remote server and process the results
DOM manipulation: changing the DOM based on results of HTTP requests
